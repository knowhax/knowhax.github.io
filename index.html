  <p>2015, came to cape town to work on a gaming project as a linux sysadmin,
  living the dream, coding and beta testing a game for work. 8000 a months, 
  and life was much simple.</p>

  <p>project ended, looking for a new job, seems like a can double my 
  salery down. Started at a new mid-size company, and got bitten by die devops 
  bug. Work that was truely cool, python, perl code, on-site server room, 
  networking across DCs bru. politic cup grew</p>

  <p>had a thought that we colectivly decided to change the tech culture. but 
  I have just concerned with learning the tools $$$</p>

  <p>aws, jenkins, terraform - deadlines too</p>

  <p>dontgoback. but i still want achivements that are truely cool.</p>
